# This dockerfile builds an image for the backend package.
# It should be executed with the root of the repo as docker context.
#
# Before building this image, be sure to have run the following commands in the repo root:
#
# yarn install
# yarn tsc
# yarn build
#
# Once the commands have been run, you can build the image using `yarn build-image`
